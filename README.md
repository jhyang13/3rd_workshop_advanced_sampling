### Description
This workshop will provide an overview of modern enhanced sampling algorithms, including replica exchange, umbrella sampling, metadynamics, and path sampling methods. It will feature of mix of lectures and hands-on exercises running GROMACS on national supercomputing resources, and will run for 3 hours each day. The workshop will include a session on diversity, equity, and inclusion aspects of computational sciences. The session will run for five days, 3-6 EDT / 2-5 CDT / 1-4 MDT / 12-3 PDT. Note that the workshop will be similar (though not exactly the same) as last yearsâ€™ workshop, whose material is posted here for reference: https://github.com/icomse/3rd_workshop_advanced_sampling
